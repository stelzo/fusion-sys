# fusion-sys

Thread safe Rust bindings for the [Fusion](https://github.com/xioTechnologies/Fusion) (v1.2.6) library for IMU filtering.

This crate currently only uses parts of the original library and is used for my own prototypes.
If you would like to add functionality, please open an issue or pull request.
